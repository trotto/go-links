# Trotto Go Links

* Apr 3, 2025 *

After careful consideration, we've made the decision to sunset the open source browser extension and we will no longer be updating the open source version of Trotto go links. Trotto was started in 2017 and we have had a wonderful journey as go links have become a beloved productivity tool for many. There are many open source go link options but we’re proud to say that Trotto is one of the best, with valuable features and proven stability. 

However, with the recent changes requested by Chrome’s Manifest v3, continuing ongoing maintenance, and a robust product roadmap of features we’d like to work on, it is no longer sustainable to try to maintain the open source version of Trotto. 

We believed that the open source version would lead more customers to eventually adopt the SaaS version but that has been proven not to work these past 7 years. 

What this means:

- The browser extension repository has been taken down
- No new features will be added
- No bug fixes will be implemented
- Issues and pull requests will be closed
- For those using the open source Chrome browser extension, Chrome will dictate how long they will continue to allow private Manifest v2 extensions

For those actively using this project, we would love if you would consider using the SaaS version of Trotto. There are a number of benefits of the SaaS version:

- Updated UI
- SSO integration
- Updated admin controls including analytics
- Available Slack app
- Manifest v3 compliant browser extension
- SOC 2 Type 2 audited
- ‘Featured’ go links

We’re grateful for everything we've learned through maintaining this project, thank you for being part of this journey.


## Trotto go links


Reliable and battle-tested continuously in production since 2017, this [go links](https://www.trot.to/go-links) solution
is used by companies all around the world daily as the core of [Trotto](https://www.trot.to).


## Features

Trotto provides all the baseline functionality you'd expect from a go links solution, including the ability to
create, use, and modify go links that are shared with your organization—and with nobody else.

Trotto also includes powerful features above and beyond a basic go links implementation, including a searchable go
links directory, a browser extension that makes go links work instantly,
and programmatic links, which are go links containing placeholders that map onto the destination
URL (ex: `go/gh/%s` pointing to `https://github.com/my_org/%s`).
