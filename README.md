## Features

Trotto provides all the baseline functionality you'd expect from a go links solution, including the ability to
create, use, and modify go links that are shared with your organizationâ€”and with nobody else.

Trotto also includes powerful features above and beyond a basic go links implementation, including a searchable go
links directory, a [browser extension](https://github.com/trotto/browser-extension) that makes go links work instantly,
and programmatic links, which are go links containing placeholders that map onto the destination
URL (ex: `go/gh/%s` pointing to `https://github.com/my_org/%s`).

For a full list of Trotto's features, check out https://www.trot.to/how-it-works.

## Authentication

At the moment, the open-source app solely supports authentication using a Google account,
but we plan to add support for additional identity providers upon request. So if you need support
for another provider, submit a GitHub issue, and we'll help you out!

## Deploy the app

See our deployment docs:

- [Deploy to Heroku](http://www.trot.to/docs/deploy/deploy-to-heroku)
- [Deploy with Docker](http://www.trot.to/docs/deploy/deploy-with-docker)

## Local development

You can bring up a local instance of Trotto within a few minutes.

### Clone this repository

```
git clone git@github.com:trotto/go-links.git
cd go-links
```

### Create a virtualenv

Inside the `go-links/server` directory, create and enter a
Python 3.8 [virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and install dependencies:

```
cd go-links/server
python3 -m venv .virtualenv
source .virtualenv/bin/activate
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

You can use `pyenv` as well.

### Add an app.yml file

Add a file at `server/src/config/app.yml` with this format:

```yaml
sessions_secret: any_secret
postgres:
  url: "postgresql://username:password@host/database"
```

`postgres.url` should be the connection string for a Postgres 12 database. The server
startup script will add the tables Trotto needs.

### Start the backend server

From the `server/` directory, run:

```
./run_local.sh
```

### Start the frontend development server

In a separate terminal, from the `frontend/` directory, run:

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Now, you can access the local instance at http://localhost:3000.

### Making changes

Most server-side and frontend changes should be picked up automatically, thanks to the Flask dev server and
[React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader).
